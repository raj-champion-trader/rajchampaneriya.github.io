# Thought Exercises

Short mental models and first-principles thinking exercises.

## Purpose

These are NOT full blog posts. They are:
- Mental frameworks
- "What if" scenarios
- First-principles explorations
- Quick insights (200-400 words)

## Great For

- LinkedIn snippets
- Short videos (60-90 seconds)
- Discussion starters
- Blog post fillers

## Example Questions

### First Principles
- "What would we change if latency didn't exist?"
- "If we had unlimited compute, how would design differ?"
- "What if every service call cost $1?"

### Assumptions
- "What assumptions break most architectures?"
- "When is 'eventual consistency' too eventual?"
- "What does 'cloud native' actually mean?"

### What Breaks First
- "What fails first in a distributed system?"
- "Which part of the architecture lies to you?"
- "What do we optimize for that doesn't matter?"

## Format

Each exercise is a single markdown file:
- Question/Premise
- Initial thinking
- Deeper exploration
- Key insight

Keep it short. The goal is to provoke thought, not provide complete answers.
