# Content Philosophy

## How I Think About Content Creation

### Core Principles

**1. Write Like an Architect, Not a Blogger**
- Focus on structure, trade-offs, and decisions
- Use diagrams to clarify thinking
- Show the reasoning, not just the conclusion

**2. Calm Confidence Over Hype**
- No clickbait or exaggeration
- Slightly sarcastic, always honest
- Respects the reader's intelligence

**3. Teaching Through Experience**
- Share what I've actually done
- Include what went wrong, not just what worked
- Anonymize client details, focus on patterns

**4. Sustainable Cadence**
- Weekly rhythm: 1.5-2 hours total
- Batch creation: idea → script → diagram → publish
- Quality threshold: would I reference this myself in 6 months?

## Content Standards

### What Makes a Good Post
- Solves a specific problem or answers a clear question
- Includes practical examples or actionable frameworks
- Has clear structure (problem → approach → lessons)
- Contains original insight, not just aggregated links

### What to Avoid
- Client-specific details (names, costs, incidents)
- Overpromising or silver bullets
- Tutorials for things I haven't used in production
- Content just for algorithm gaming

## Topic Selection

### Always Relevant
- Architecture decision frameworks
- System design trade-offs
- Delivery patterns that prevent failure
- Azure/cloud architecture patterns

### When It Matters
- New tool/technology: only after hands-on experience
- Industry trend: only if I have unique perspective
- Opinion piece: only if I can defend it with evidence

### Never Touch
- Politics, religion, personal drama
- Confidential client information
- Controversial takes just for engagement
- Topics outside my expertise without clear disclaimer

## Writing Style

**Tone**: Professional, approachable, slightly dry humor  
**Length**: As long as needed, as short as possible  
**Format**: Clear structure, visual breaks, scannable  
**Language**: Simple words, complex ideas

## Measurement

Success is NOT:
- Viral posts or huge follower counts
- Daily engagement metrics
- Likes and shares

Success IS:
- Content I'm proud to show in interviews
- Messages from people who found it useful
- Being invited to speak or consult based on writing
- Building knowledge that compounds
