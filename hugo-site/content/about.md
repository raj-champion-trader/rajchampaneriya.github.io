# About Me

## Positioning Statement

Principal Consultant / Architect specializing in Azure cloud solutions. I help teams ship reliable, scalable systems while navigating complexity with clarity. Currently focused on enterprise architecture patterns and delivery excellence.

## Core Strengths

- Cloud architecture on Azure
- Technical pre-sales and consulting
- System design and trade-off analysis
- Team leadership and mentoring
- Clear technical communication

## What I Write About

### 1. Architecture Patterns
Practical system design, trade-offs, and decision frameworks for real-world systems.

### 2. Delivery Wisdom
What works (and what breaks) in actual projects - lessons from the trenches, not textbooks.

### 3. Continuous Learning
Insights from technical papers, books, and hands-on experience.

## My Approach

I believe in:
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Show how you think, not how smart you are
- **Experience over theory** - Share what I've actually done
- **Quality over quantity** - One strong insight beats ten shallow posts
- **Long-term thinking** - Building knowledge that compounds

I'm **not** trying to:
- Go viral or chase follower counts
- Be a "thought leader" without substance
- Teach things I haven't used in production

## Background

[TODO: Add your specific professional background]
