I'm Raj Champaneriya — a Solution Architect focused on cloud modernization and AI-enabled platforms for enterprise environments.

Over the last 13+ years, I've worked across industries including healthcare, insurance, media, and logistics, helping teams modernize legacy systems, design scalable architectures, and deliver measurable outcomes. My work sits at the intersection of architecture, delivery, and stakeholder alignment — turning ambiguous problem statements into executable technical strategy.

I focus on:
- **Cloud architecture (Azure/AWS)**: platform foundations, security, networking, reliability, and governance  
- **Modernization**: .NET modernization, integration, microservices, and cost optimization  
- **Applied AI**: practical GenAI patterns, RAG architectures, guardrails, and production readiness  
- **Consulting execution**: framing options, trade-offs, and decisions clearly for technical and business leaders

This site is my working notebook: architecture notes, reference implementations, diagrams, and lessons learned from building systems that have to survive audits, outages, and Monday morning status calls.
