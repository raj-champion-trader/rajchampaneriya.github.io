> **At a glance:** A real-time market data simulation system, built for **architects** and **leaders**. Clean layered design, sub-100ms latency, and deliberate technology choices—Redis Streams, SSE, quantitative price models—documented for clarity and reuse.

</div>

## What It Is

The Stock Market Simulator is a **real-time market data simulation system** that generates statistically realistic synthetic prices and streams them to a web UI. Four Indian symbols—**NIFTY50**, **BANKNIFTY**, **RELIANCE**, and **TCS**—are simulated with distinct volatility profiles. Data flows from a price engine through a message broker to the browser via Server-Sent Events, creating a practical reference for event-driven, low-latency architecture.

**Why it matters for leadership:** The system demonstrates how to achieve reliability, scalability, and observability with a small set of well-chosen patterns—consumer groups, bounded channels, event streaming—without the overhead of heavier enterprise middleware. It is documented with formal Architecture Decision Records and C4-style diagrams in the [repository](https://github.com/raj-champion-trader/stock-market-simulator).

## Logical Architecture

The system is organized in four logical layers: **Presentation**, **Application**, **Integration & Data**, and **Data Source**. The diagram below is the single source of truth for how capabilities are grouped and how data and control flow between them.

</figure>

| Layer | Capabilities |
|-------|---------------|
| **Presentation** | Trader/viewer (actor), Web frontend (React, TypeScript, D3) |
| **Application** | Market Ingestion API, Broker Service (SSE, aggregation), OpenTelemetry (OTLP) |
| **Integration & Data** | Redis Streams (message broker, consumer groups) |
| **Data Source** | Market Simulator (price generation: GBM, GARCH) |

---

## How It Flows

Data is **generated** by the Market Simulator (quantitative models), **ingested** and validated by the API, **stored** and distributed via Redis Streams, and **consumed** by the Broker Service, which aggregates candlesticks and streams updates to the Web Frontend over SSE. End-to-end latency is sub-100ms. Deployment is orchestrated with .NET Aspire (single `dotnet run`); Redis is provisioned via Docker. For detailed data-flow and sequence diagrams, see the [reference docs and mermaid diagrams in the repo](https://github.com/raj-champion-trader/stock-market-simulator/tree/main/reference-docs).

### See it in action

The app runs with a single command. Below, a short tour of the working prototype—live UI, Aspire dashboard, and development setup. Auto-advances when in view; use **Pause** to hold on a slide.

## Quality Attributes

- **Performance** — Sub-100ms latency; bounded channels and backpressure so slow clients do not affect others.
- **Scalability** — Horizontally scalable brokers using Redis consumer groups; stateless services for load balancing.
- **Reliability** — SSE reconnection with Last-Event-ID replay; Redis persistence; health checks and ordered startup via Aspire.
- **Observability** — OpenTelemetry (OTLP) across .NET services; Redis monitoring in the UI; structured logging.
- **Maintainability** — Clear separation of services; shared contracts; dependency injection; 10 ADRs for major decisions.

## Key Architectural Decisions

The project maintains **10 formal ADRs** in the repository. Summary for executives and architects:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Redis Streams** over Kafka/RabbitMQ | Consumer groups, ordering, bounded retention, and lower operational complexity for this scale. |
| **SSE** over WebSockets | Server-to-client only; native reconnection and Last-Event-ID; simpler and proxy-friendly. |
| **Backend candlestick aggregation** | Single source of truth; consistent candle boundaries and OHLCV across all clients. |
| **Custom D3.js charts** | Full control and no licensing dependency; TradingView-style UX without the library. |

Deep dives, alternatives considered, and tradeoffs are in the [ADR folder](https://github.com/raj-champion-trader/stock-market-simulator/tree/main/reference-docs) in the repo.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Orchestration | .NET Aspire |
| Backend | .NET 10 |
| Message broker | Redis Streams 7.x |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript 5.9, MUI 7, D3.js 7.9 |
| Build | Vite 7 |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry (OTLP) |

---

## Future Directions

1. Historical data replay from Redis stream history  
2. Technical indicators (e.g. MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) on charts  
3. Multi-timeframe aggregation (1m, 5m, 1h)  
4. Order book simulation and market depth  
5. Authentication and per-user watchlists  

---

## Conclusion

The Stock Market Simulator shows how a **focused set of architecture decisions**—event streaming, consumer groups, SSE, backend aggregation—yields a system that is reliable, scalable, and observable. The value for architects and leaders is in the clarity of the logical design and the documented rationale; for senior engineers, the repo provides full C4 and mermaid diagrams, ADRs, and implementation details.
