I'm a hands-on Solution Architect who enjoys solving hard problems — the kind where legacy systems, business pressure, and scale collide.

Over the last 13+ years, I've helped enterprises modernize platforms, adopt cloud and AI responsibly, and turn technical complexity into business advantage. I believe good architecture is invisible, scalable, and boring in production — and that's a compliment.

When I'm not designing systems, I mentor engineers, write about architecture, and experiment with AI-driven tools that make teams faster and decisions smarter.
